# ðŸ“š Text-Analysis-and-Topic-Modeling

This repository contains NLP notebooks on text mining, topic modeling, and corpus generation, including web scraping, genre classification, LDA modeling, and LLM-based text classification using Tomotopy, scikit-learn, and transformers. The projects demonstrate practical applications of LLMs and topic modeling for analysing large text datasets such as Papers Past and TED Talks.
